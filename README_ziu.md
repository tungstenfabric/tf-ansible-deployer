# ZIU Ansible
Sequence of steps to perform Zero impact upgrade unsing ansible:
1. Upgrade contrail_container_tag in instances.yaml to set proper version of contrail
2. Run `control` stage of `ziu.yml` playbook to upgrade the control plane:
```sh
sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e stage=control -e orchestrator=openstack -e config_file=../instances.yaml playbooks/ziu.yml
```
3. Run `openstack` stage of `ziu.yml` playbook to upgrade openstack plugin
```sh
sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e stage=openstack -e orchestrator=openstack -e config_file=../instances.yaml playbooks/ziu.yml
```
4. Run contrail-status to check all works well
5. Migrate workloads VM from one group of compute nodes. Leave them uncommented in the instances.yaml. Comment other computes not ready to upgr–∞de in instances.yaml.
6. Run `compute` stage of `ziu.yml` playbook to upgrade compute nodes (group that uncommented in instances.yml).
```sh
sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e stage=compute -e orchestrator=openstack -e config_file=../instances.yaml playbooks/ziu.yml
```
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all groups of compute nodes
